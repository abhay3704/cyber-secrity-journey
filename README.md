# 🛡️ Abhay's Cybersecurity Journey

Hi! I'm Abhay, a B.Tech 3rd year student passionate about starting a career in cybersecurity.  
I began this journey with **zero coding or hacking knowledge**, and this repo is where I’ll document my learning path.

## 📅 Weekly Progress
Each week, I’ll update:
- ✅ TryHackMe rooms I complete
- 🧪 Tools I explore (like Nmap, Wireshark, etc.)
- 🧠 Notes from Linux and security basics
- 📝 Weekly reflections and plans

## 📚 Platforms I'm Learning From
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)
- [Google Cybersecurity Course](https://coursera.org)

## 📌 Goals
- Build a strong cybersecurity foundation
- Complete 20+ TryHackMe rooms
- Apply for a SOC Analyst or Cybersecurity Internship

Stay tuned 👀 — I'm just getting started!
